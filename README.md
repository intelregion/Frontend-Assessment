# Frontend-Assessment

### Event Management Dashboard

#### Objective:
Create a responsive web application for managing events. The application should allow users to view, create, edit, and delete events. It should also include user authentication and authorization, dynamic data fetching, and a polished UI/UX.

#### Requirements:
1. **Authentication & Authorization:**
   - Implement user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
   - Only authenticated users can create, edit, or delete events.
   - Use role-based authorization (e.g., Admin, User).

2. **Event Management:**
   - Display a list of upcoming events in a grid or list view.
   - Allow users to create new events with fields: Event Name, Date, Time, Description, and Location.
   - Implement edit and delete functionality for events.
   - Show detailed view of an event when clicked.

3. **Dynamic Data Fetching:**
   - Fetch events data from a mock API (you can use tools like JSONPlaceholder or create a simple backend with Node.js/Express).
   - Implement search functionality to filter events by name or date.

4. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure the application is fully responsive and works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
   - Use a modern CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap).

5. **Polished UI/UX:**
   - Provide a user-friendly interface with smooth animations and transitions.
   - Use icons and images appropriately to enhance the user experience.
   - Ensure form validation and user feedback for all actions (e.g., success and error messages).

6. **Code Quality:**
   - Write clean, modular, and maintainable code.
   - Use TypeScript for type safety.
   - Follow best practices for React development.

#### Bonus Points:
- Implement a calendar view for events.
- Add unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library.
- Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).

### Evaluation Criteria:
1. **Functionality:**
   - Completeness of the features.
   - Correctness of the implementation.
   - User authentication and role-based access control.

2. **Code Quality:**
   - Code organization and structure.
   - Use of TypeScript and type safety.
   - Adherence to best practices and design patterns.

3. **UI/UX Design:**
   - Aesthetics and usability of the interface.
   - Responsiveness and accessibility.
   - User feedback and error handling.

4. **Performance:**
   - Efficient data fetching and state management.
   - Fast loading times and smooth interactions.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Clear and concise README file.
   - Comments and documentation within the code.
